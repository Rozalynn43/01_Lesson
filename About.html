      <p>Hi, I'm Rozalynn Gholston, an aspiring software engineer with over 4 years of coding experience in Java, Python, and currently C++. I'm passionate about building real-world software solutions and continuously expanding my technical skill set.

I'm currently a Computer Science major at Colorado State University Global, balancing my studies with a role at Amazon’s warehouse in Atlanta, GA. This experience has taught me discipline, adaptability, and the value of hard work—traits I carry into my approach to software engineering.

In the past, I’ve also worked with the nonprofit organization HYPE (Hope for Youth in Providing Education), where I contributed to projects focused on community impact and youth empowerment.

I aim to work as a software engineer at Amazon or another major tech company where I can grow as a developer and contribute to large-scale, innovative projects.

Be sure to check out the Projects tab—one highlight is a website I built completely from scratch using Glitch, which showcases my ability to bring ideas to life through code.</p>
